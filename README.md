Hello!

🎮 I'm a video game lawyer (specialising in intellectual property and privacy), currently working as a Senior Legal Counsel at CD PROJEKT RED. Based in Warsaw, Poland.

🐧 I'm a long time FLOSS (free/libre and open source software) enthusiast. I got into FLOSS because it helped me satiate my need to tinker and learn new stuff.

👨‍💻 Currently I'm tinkering with Python and JavaScript.
